## Deadline

Deadline for online submission will be  on  **Thursday 16/3/2020 11:59 PM**

## Joining to Assignment Repository

**This is an individual assignment**

1. Go to the [Assignment Page](https://classroom.github.com/a/tulGkaag).
2. Accept the assignment.
3. Wait till your repository created.
4. Open the link and Clone repository.

## Required

1. Train an SVM, Bayes Naive, and Decision Tree classifier on the **MNIST dataset**. Use Binary classifiers only. Thus, you will need to use **one-versus-all** to classify all 10 digits. You may want to tune the
hyperparameters using small validation sets to speed up the process. What accuracy can you
reach?

2. Build an Ensemble Voting classifier by comparing between Bagging and Pasting using the three classifiers utilized in item 1.

3. Write a markdown report to compare between the three individual classifiers and the Voting classifier using both bagging and pasting methods.

### Submitting

```terminal
$ git commit -a -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```
