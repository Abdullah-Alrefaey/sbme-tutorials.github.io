    "What we have taken ? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We started by representation of digital image as a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a gray level for gray images. For color images, each pixel has three channels mainly R, G, and B. Then we investigated different color spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards we moved to some image manipulation methods to enhance the image using histogram transforms. Then we moved to image filtering and denoising. And finally to edge detection and enhancement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What's next ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now we didn't get into the main objective of computer vision which is transform the image to model and make it easy to interpret images, identify objects in it, and recognize them. Here we start with basic algorithm (Hough transform) that enables us to identify and detect lines, circles, and other geometric shapes. \n",

    "So to detect the line in the image space we have to define these parameters, which is not applicable in image domain. In the other domain with $$m$$ and $$b$$ coordinates, line represent a point from image domain. Points on the same line in image domain will be mapped to lines in Hough domain. These lines intersect with each other in a point with specific values $$m$$ and $$b$$. These values are the slope and y-intercept of original line in image domain. \n",
    " \n",
    "For example in the following image. \n",

    "\n",
    "Due to undefined value of slope for vertical lines in cartesian coordinates, we have to move to polar coordinates. In polar coordinates line is define by $$\\rho$$ and $$\\theta$$ where $$\\rho$$ is the norm distance of the line from origin. $$\\theta$$ is the angle between the norm and the horizontal $$x$$ axis. The equation of line in terms of $$\\rho$$ and $$\\theta$$ now is \n",
