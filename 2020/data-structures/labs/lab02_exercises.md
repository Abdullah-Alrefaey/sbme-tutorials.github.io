## Application 1: Range Summation

As mathematical historians have told the story, the German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) began to show his mathematical talent at a very
early age. When he was in elementary school, Gauss was asked by his teacher
to compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and 100. Gauss is said to have
given the answer instantly: 5050. Write a program that computes the answer to
the question Gauss’s teacher posed.


Starting from the following code (name the file as `range_sum.cpp`):

```c++
int range_sum( int start, int end )
{

}

int main()
{

}
```

Finally compile your file:

```bash
g++ range_sum.cpp -o summer.out
```

Test your program:

```bash
./summer.out
1 100
5050
```


## Application 2: Find the roots

Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

If you don’t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research. Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can teach the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the user inputs for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since there are two
solutions to a quadratic equation, output both `x1` and `x2`.

Starting from the following code (name the file as `root.cpp`):

```c++
void root( double a, double b, double c, double &x1, double &x2)
{
    

}

int main()
{
    
    
}
```
