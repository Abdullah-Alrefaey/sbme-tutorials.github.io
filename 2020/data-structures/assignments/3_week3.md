## Assignment: Part 1

Go to the [assignment page](https://classroom.github.com/a/cTs5DbJ9) and git clone your own repository.

### Overview

You will learn how to work with multiple files. We will write our interesting functions in header files, and then use these functions in our interesting applications.

#### The header files (library)

We will work and implement our logic inside these files:

* `mathematics.hpp` to contain some **mathematical** functions like `calculation`.
* `arrays.hpp` to contain our **array** functions.
* `ecg.hpp` to contain analysis functions on **ECG**.
* `dna.hpp` to contain analysis functions on **DNA**.

Our source files of our applications that we are going to compile into useful and **very important applications**:

* `calculator.cpp` to implement the *Calculator* application, and depends on `mathematics.hpp`.
* `heron.cpp` to implement a simple application that implements *Heron Formula*, and also depends on `mathematics.hpp`.
* `analyzeECG.cpp` to implement **very useful** application for *ECG Analysis*, depends on `ecg.hpp`.
* `analyzeDNA.cpp` to implement **very useful** application for *DNA Analysis*, depends on `dna.hpp`.

You will find a useful header file `helpers.hpp`, **I don't recommend you to try understanding it before week 6**. We will just use two functions from `helpers.hpp` to load our **DNA** and **ECG** files from hard disk.

#### Dependency Graph

![dependencies](task3.svg)

By the way, keep in mind, that **application source files** that are compiled into **executable files**, has to be:

* including a `main` function. Each `main` function is a simply program entry point.
* and `main` function should be existing in a `.cpp` file.

You will also realize our header files begin and ends with

```c++
#ifndef MATHEMATICS_HPP
#define MATHEMATICS_HPP

// includes of external headers here

// Your functions here

#endif // MATHEMATICS_HPP
```

No worries, they are called [header guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard). Will be explained on next tutorial on **Sunday**. But just consider them as a skeleton (boilerplate) code.

### Requirement 1: **mathematics.hpp** file

* **R1.1 (Done for you)** Make a `namespace mathematics` that will contain our functions.
* **R1.2** Implement our `calculation` function using either **if, else if, else** or **switch-case**.
* **R1.3** Implement [Heron Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%27s_formula), that is used to compute the **triangle area** given its three sides, hmmmm very interesting.

![tri](triangle.png)

$$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)},$$

where *s* is the *semiperimeter* of the triangle; that is,

$$ s=\frac{a+b+c}{2}. $$

Use this function declaration:

```c++
double heron( double a , double b , double c )
{
    // Logic here
}
```

You also need to `#include <cmath>` as an external header, to use `std::sqrt` function that computes the square root.

* **R1.4** It is your job now to implement the `main` function in `heron.cpp` file. It is required to make the *Heron Formula* application to **receive the three parameters of the triangle through terminal**. So you will retrieve the three parameters through the `argv` in `main` function. Remember that you will need to use `std::atof` function and `#include <string>`. To use `mathematics::heron`, add `#include "mathematics.hpp"`. Hint, you may cheat from `calculation.cpp` source file (but with receiving three doubles in this case).

### Requirement 2: **arrays.hpp** file

* **R2.1** Make a `namespace arrays` that will contain our functions.
* **R2.2** Implement a function that prints all array elements on terminal, using the following declaration:

```c++
void printAll( double *base , int arraySize )
{
    // Logic here
}
```

* **R2.3**+**R2.4** Implement a function that returns the **maximum** element and another one for **minimum** element, using the following declarations:

```c++
double maxArray( double *base, int arraySize )
{
    // Logic here
}

double minArray( double *base, int arraySize )
{
    // Logic here
}
```

* **R2.5**+**R2.6** Implement a function that returns the **mean (average)** of array elements and another one that returns the **variance**, using the following declaration:

```c++
double meanArray( double *base , int arraySize )
{
    // Logic here
}


double varianceArray( double *base, int arraySize )
{
    // Logic here

    // Hint: use meanArray ;)
    // Do you need a square function?
    // Maybe you can implement one in mathematics.hpp
    // then include "mathematics.hpp" to use mathematics::square here
}
```

If you don't know variance,

$$ var = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} ( \text{mean} - x_i )^2 $$


### Requirement 3: **ecg.hpp** file

* **R3.1** Make a `namespace ecg` that will contain our function.
* **R3.2** Make a function that computes the **average**, **variance**, **max**, and **min** of **ECG** signal. But these are not single variables so we can return. Alternatively, we will use **4 reference** variable in function declaration.

```c++
void analyzeECG( double *base , int arraySize , double &mean, double &variance, double &max, double &min )
{
    // Logic here (4 lines)
}
```

Use the four functions we already implemented in `arrays.hpp`. Accordingly, **four lines** are sufficient to do this job. And yes, don't forget to `#include "arrays.hpp"` in the current header file.

### Requirement 4: **dna.hpp** file and revisiting **arrays.hpp** file

#### Revisit **arrays.hpp** file

* **R4.1** Make a function that counts a given character in array of characters, using the following declaration:

```c++
int countCharacter( char *basePointer , int size , char query )
{
    // Logic here
} 
```

#### Now **dna.hpp** file

* **R4.1** Make a `namespace dna` that will contain our functions.
* **R4.2** Implement `complementaryBase` you did in the first week using either **if, else if, else** or **switch-case**, with the following declaration:

```c++
char complementaryBase( char base )
{
    // Logic here
}
```

* **R4.3** Implement `complementarySequence` function that returns the complementary **DNA** sequence.

Please beware that the double strands of our **DNA** are directional, and they have opposite directions.

For example, the sequence *ACG* has a complementary sequence *CGT*, **not** *TGC*.

So in your for loop, you may read the *original* sequence from begining, and write the complementary sequence starting from the *end* of the complementary sequence array.

By the way, you have to allocate the complementary sequence on the heap (dynamic array) at the begining of function (using the given size).

Use the following declaration:

```c++
char * complementarySequence( char *base, int size )
{
    // Your logic here
}
```

* **R4.4** Implement `analyzeDNA` function that counts the 4 bases in a sequence, and returns the complementary sequence. Again, you have four counters and a complementary sequence. So you only return the complementary sequence, and the counters will saved back to reference integers. Remember to use `arrays::countChar` and to `#include "arrays.hpp"` in the current file. Use the following declaration:

```c++
char *analyzeDNA( char *base, int size, int &countA, int &countC, int &countG, int &countT )
{
    // Your logic here (5 lines).
}
```

## Submission and Bonus Policy

* As usual, commit and push your changes.
* Also, you may obtain bonus with correct logic by consistent adoption of [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principles. Also, make your code clean, well-aligned, and use descriptive variable names.

## Generating Executables and Testing Output

### Compiling and Testing calculator.cpp

```bash
$ g++ calculator.cpp -o Calculator
$ ./Calculator 24 / 7
3.42857
$ ./Calculator 24 \* 7
```

**Note: asterisk `*` is a special character for the terminal. You need to explicitly use `\*` to specify multiplication operation.**

### Compiling and Testing heron.cpp

```bash
$ g++ heron.cpp -o Heron
$ ./Heron 3 4 5
6
```

### Compiling and Testing analyzeECG.cpp

We compile and test using an ECG dataset stored in `datasets/ecg_data.txt`.

Our application in the `main` function loads data from the file then use `ecg::analyzeECG`
function implemented in `ecg.hpp`.

```bash
$ g++ analyzeECG.cpp -o AnalyzeECG
$ ./AnalyzeECG datasets/ecg_data.txt
ECG average : 0.82964
ECG variance: 0.00865574
ECG range   : (0.592,1.408)
```

### Compiling and Testing analyzeDNA.cpp

We compile and test using a DNA dataset stored in `datasets/hepatitis_c_virus_genome.txt`.

Our application in the `main` function loads data from the file then use `dna::analyzeDNA`
function implemented in `dna.hpp`.

```bash
$ g++ analyzeDNA.cpp -o AnalyzeDNA
$ ./AnalyzeDNA datasets/hepatitis_c_virus_genome.txt
Adenine (A) content:??
Guanine (G) content:??
Cytocine(C) content:??
Thymine (T) content:??

Complementary Sequence:
??
```

The actual values of A, C, G, T contents are hidden as well as the complementary sequence. Obtaining the correct values will grant you a **bonus grade** for this task.
